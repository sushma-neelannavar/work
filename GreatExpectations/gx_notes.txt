Demo:

Points Captured during Great Expectations Demo:

1. Donna raised a question if the data quality check can be done for data type of the column
2. Do we have schema check validation - Yes
3. Can it be integrated at any stage of the data pipeline - Yes can be integrated from raw to stage and stage to destination
4. How fast it is in processing large set of data - since it supports both pandas and pyspark volume of data is not a constaine
5. Can a same expectation be used for different tables for validations - Yes, have to write expectations specific to that table
6. test suits can be edited and run at any point of the pipeline
7. Can be integrated with the existing pipelines and get the data check result in UI
8. We can also push html output git and can verify the data validation
9. Can we place the code in production? -- Prod does not support Pandas-- in that case we can use the Pyspark 
10. Can it handle missing value ? - No
11. Should implement it with some array structured tables as a future enhancement
12. Data completeness

Actions:
1.	Check the great expectation library  support on pnc env. â€“ shiva, sunil
2.	Set up call with Donna to identify use case  - shiva
3.	Share the ETA for  the use case  identified in #2- shiva
